migrations are DB queries (not actual raw queries, but all backgrouod stuff is run by django loader in raw form)
- not visible to developer

each app has its own migration - ye sab 1 app hai -- auth, admin.. all created by django
out app is inspection only yet, and no migration coz no db stuff yet

auth, admin, sessions.. ye sab djangio khud provide krta hai,, managed in db, has to be run by us

django DB migrations commands :

pwd : should be where manage.py lives (of course lol)

python manage.py showmigrations -- ( to see what has happened, and what can happen - crossed ones are applied, uncrossed are not)
python manage.py makemigrations - it does nothing, just shows you what is to be done
python manage.py migrate - it'll mnigrate what was shown in makemigrations command's output
the actuall db changes (schema, new table.. anything) will be done via above


DB configs - inside settings.py (define which DB to use - kaun sa karna hai ? ya karna bhi hai  >)

db create krte hain
aur 1 user
ye server automatically changes reload krta hai,, only python and server side changes, not the html and client ones

ye static files kabhi 1 baar me nahi chalta
